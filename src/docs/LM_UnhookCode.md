# LM_UnhookCode

```c
LM_API lm_bool_t LM_CALL
LM_UnhookCode(lm_address_t from,
	      lm_address_t trampoline,
	      lm_size_t    size);
```

# Description
The function removes a hook/detour placed on the address `from`, restoring it to its original state.
The function also frees the trampoline allocated by `LM_HookCode`.

# Parameters
 - `from`: The address where the hook was placed.
 - `trampoline`: The address of the trampoline generated by `LM_HookCode`.
 - `size`: The amount of bytes occupied by the hook (aligned to the nearest instruction).

# Return Value
`LM_TRUE` on success, `LM_FALSE` on failure.
